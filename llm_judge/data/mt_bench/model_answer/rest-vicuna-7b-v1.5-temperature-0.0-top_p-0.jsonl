In this travel blog, we embark on a journey to explore the cultural wonders of Hawaii, delving into its unique traditions, history, and must-see attractions. Join us as we uncover the essence of this enchanting archipelago and create unforgettable memories along the way.\n\nDay 1: Oahu - Honolulu and Waikiki\n\nOur adventure began in Honolulu, the bustling capital city of Oahu. As we strolled along the iconic Waikiki Beach, we couldn't help but marvel at the stunning turquoise waters and golden sand. The vibrant atmosphere of the beachfront was a perfect introduction to the island's lively spirit.\n\nIn the evening, we immersed ourselves in Hawaiian culture by attending a traditional luau. The event was a feast for both our senses and souls, as we enjoyed a delicious Hawaiian feast, watched skilled dancers perform ancient hula dances, and listened to the soothing sounds of traditional Hawaiian music.\n\nDay 2: Oahu - Pearl Harbor and USS Arizona Memorial\n\nThe next day, we paid tribute to the past by visiting the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor. This solemn site commemorates the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japanese forces in 1941, which led to the United States' entry into World War II. The memorial, built above the sunken battleship, offers a hauntingly beautiful view of the wreckage below.\n\nAfterward, we explored the Pearl Harbor Visitor Center, where we learned about the history of the attack and the vital role that Hawaii played in the war.\n\nDay 3: Big Island - Hawaii Volcanoes National Park\n\nOur journey took us to the Big Island, where we embarked on an awe-inspiring adventure to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. This breathtaking park encompasses two active volcanoes: Kilauea and Mauna Loa. We marveled at the otherworldly landscapes, steam vents, and bubbling pools of lava, which are a testament to the island's volcanic origins.\n\nIn the evening, we attended a traditional Hawaiian imu ceremony, where we witnessed the ancient art of cooking underground. The event was a delightful fusion of culture and cuisine, as we enjoyed a delicious feast of kalua pig, chicken, and sweet potatoes, all cooked in an underground oven.\n\nDay 4: Big Island - Hilo and Akaka Falls\n\nThe next day, we explored the charming town of Hilo, known for its lush gardens and waterfalls. We visited the picturesque Akaka Falls, a 442-foot-tall cascade that plunges into a lush gorge. The stunning beauty of the falls was a perfect representation of the island's natural wonders.\n\nIn the afternoon, we visited the Pacific Tsunami Museum, which provided a sobering glimpse into the devastating impact of tsunamis on the island's history and culture.\n\nDay 5: Maui - Haleakala National Park\n\nOur journey continued to the island of Maui, where we embarked on a sunrise tour of Haleakala National Park. This breathtaking park encompasses the summit of Haleakala, a dormant volcano, and is home to a diverse array of plant and animal life.\n\nAs we watched the sunrise from the summit, we were awestruck by the stunning vistas that stretched out before us, including the island of Lanai and the Molokini Crater.\n\nDay 6: Maui -</s>", "Awe-inspiring adventures awaited us in Hawaii, a tropical paradise in the Pacific Ocean.

But despite its decrepit appearance, the house held a secret that no one had ever discovered.\n\nOne day, a young girl named Lily was walking home from school when she noticed the old house. She had always been fascinated by it, with its mysterious air of abandonment. She had heard the rumors, of course, that it was haunted, but that only made her more curious. As she approached the house, she noticed that the front door was slightly ajar. She couldn't resist the urge to peek inside.\n\nAs she stepped inside, she was immediately struck by the musty smell of the place. Cobwebs hung from the ceiling, and the floorboards creaked beneath her feet. But despite the creepy atmosphere, Lily felt a strange sense of excitement. She had never been inside the old house before, and she was determined to uncover its secret.\n\nShe began to explore the house, moving from room to room. In one of the upstairs bedrooms, she found an old trunk in the corner. She opened it, and inside, she found a stack of yellowing letters and photographs. They were all addressed to a woman named Sarah, and they seemed to be from her husband, who had been away at war. The letters were filled with love and longing, and Lily could feel the emotions pouring off the page.\n\nAs she read through the letters, she began to understand the secret that the old house had been hiding. It was a secret that had been hidden for decades, but Lily was the first person to uncover it. The letters revealed that Sarah had been in love with another woman, and that their love had been forbidden in the small town where they lived. They had been forced to keep their relationship a secret, and they had hidden their love letters in the old house.\n\nLily felt a sense of awe as she realized the significance of what she had found. The letters were a testament to love and courage, and they had been hidden away for all those years. She knew that she had stumbled upon something truly special, and she felt a sense of responsibility to keep the secret safe.\n\nAs she left the old house, Lily felt a sense of pride. She had uncovered a secret that no one else had ever discovered, and she had done it in a way that was both brave and respectful.

It is trained using large amounts of text data, which can be labeled or unlabeled.\n\nWhen a language model is trained on labeled data, it means that the data has been annotated with information about the correct output for each input. For example, if you were training a language model on a dataset of movie reviews, the data might be labeled with the corresponding movie title and rating. This type of training allows the language model to learn the patterns and relationships within the data and make accurate predictions based on that information.\n\nOn the other hand, if a language model is trained on unlabeled data, it means that the data has not been annotated with any information about the correct output. The model is still able to learn from the data, but it does not have the same level of supervision as a labeled model. This type of training is often used for tasks such as language translation or text summarization, where the goal is to generate coherent and meaningful text rather than to make specific predictions.\n\nOverall, the choice between labeled and unlabeled data depends on the specific task and the amount of data available for training. Labeled data can provide more accurate and reliable results, but it can also be more time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Unlabeled data can be more abundant and easier to access, but it may require more advanced techniques to extract useful information from it.</s>", "It is true that different companies may use different approaches to train language models, and some may claim that their approach is safer or more effective than others. However, it is important to keep in mind that the safety and effectiveness of a language model depend on many factors, including the quality and quantity of the training data, the architecture of the model, and the specific task it is being trained to perform.\n\nOne approach that some companies may use is to use unlabeled data to train their language models. This approach can be more efficient and cost-effective than using labeled data, but it may also result in less accurate or reliable predictions. Additionally, some companies may use techniques such as data augmentation or adversarial training to improve the safety and robustness of their language models. These techniques involve generating additional training data or creating adversarial examples that can challenge the model and help it learn to resist attacks or biases.\n\nUltimately, the safety and effectiveness of a language model depend on many factors, and it is important to carefully evaluate the approach and methods used by any company before trusting their products. It is also important to keep in mind that language models, like all artificial intelligence systems, are not perfect and can still make mistakes or exhibit biases.</s>"], "idxs": [172, 168], "new_tokens": [317, 263], "wall_time": [11.256386041641235, 11.250232696533203], "accept_lengths:": [0, 1, 4, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]}], "tstamp": 1712634678.1229312}

Euclidean geometry is used to describe and measure the properties of shapes such as circles, triangles, and rectangles.\n\nRiemannian geometry, on the other hand, is a type of geometry that is used to describe and measure the properties of curved surfaces, such as the surface of a sphere or the surface of a doughnut. In Riemannian geometry, the distance between two points is not necessarily a straight line, but rather the shortest curve or path between the two points. The concept of angles is also different in Riemannian geometry, as it is based on the idea of a \"geodesic angle,\" which is the angle formed by two intersecting curves on a curved surface.\n\nIn summary, Euclidean geometry is used to describe and measure the properties of flat shapes, while Riemannian geometry is used to describe and measure the properties of curved surfaces.</s>"], "idxs": [44, 158], "new_tokens": [103, 264], "wall_time": [2.8636434078216553, 10.458552837371826], "accept_lengths:": [2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 2, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 6, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 7, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1]}], "tstamp": 1712634691.6329672}

We can do this through public outreach campaigns, school programs, and other educational initiatives.\n\nSecond, we need to provide incentives for deforesters to switch to more sustainable practices. This could include financial incentives, such as tax breaks or subsidies for sustainable forestry practices, or recognition programs that reward deforesters for their efforts to protect the environment.\n\nFinally, we need to hold deforesters accountable for their actions. This could include stricter regulations and enforcement of existing laws, as well as penalties for those who violate them.\n\nBy taking these steps, we can convince the deforesters to stop cutting down trees and protect the environment for future generations to enjoy.</s>"], "idxs": [144, 291], "new_tokens": [263, 512], "wall_time": [9.41034460067749, 19.395005226135254], "accept_lengths:": [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 2, 5, 5, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 5, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 7, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1, 4, 9, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1]}], "tstamp": 1712634749.6421173}

We can do this by adding an additional dimension to the `dp` array, which will keep track of the LCS length for each position in the common prefix.\n\nHere is the modified function:\n```\ndef longest_common_subsequence(X, Y):\n    m = len(X)\n    n = len(Y)\n\n    lcs = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if X[i - 1] == Y[j - 1]:\n                lcs[i][j] = lcs[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n                for k in range(i + 1, m + 1):\n                    lcs[k][j] = max(lcs[k][j], lcs[i][j - 1] + 1)\n            else:\n                lcs[i][j] = max(lcs[i - 1][j], lcs[i][j - 1])\n\n    return lcs[m][n]\n```\nThis modified function will correctly return the length of the longest common subsequence of the two input strings.</s>"], "idxs": [211, 200], "new_tokens": [402, 393], "wall_time": [13.934755563735962, 13.746966123580933], "accept_lengths:": [2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 5, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 2, 1, 3, 4, 6, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 5, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 2, 1, 3, 4, 6, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]}], "tstamp": 1712635084.2036493}

This means that a quantum system can be in more than one state at the same time, and the actual state of the system can only be determined by observing or measuring it.\n\nFor example, in the case of a quantum particle such as an electron, it is possible for the particle to be in multiple locations at the same time, as long as the locations are not in conflict with each other. This is because the wave function of the particle describes a superposition of different possible states or locations.\n\nQuantum entanglement is a phenomenon that occurs when two or more quantum particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other particle, even if they are separated by large distances. This means that the properties of the particles are connected in a way that cannot be explained by classical physics.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of quantum entanglement is the \"Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\" (EPR) experiment, which was proposed by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen in 1935. In this experiment, two particles are created in a quantum superposition of being entangled or not entangled. If the particles are entangled, then measuring the state of one particle will instantly determine the state of the other particle, regardless of the distance between them. This violates the principle of locality, which is a fundamental assumption of classical physics.\n\nSuperposition and entanglement are closely related in that superposition is a necessary condition for entanglement to occur. In order for two particles to become entangled, they must first be in a superposition of being entangled or not entangled. Once the particles are in this superposition, measuring the state of one particle will instantly determine the state of the other particle, even if they are separated by large distances.</s>", "In my response, I made the following assumptions:\n\n1.

However, we can make an estimate based on some general assumptions and average values.\n\nFirst, let's consider the rate of photosynthesis. The rate of photosynthesis varies depending on the species of tree and its environmental conditions, but on average, a mature tree can produce about 20-30 grams of glucose per day through photosynthesis.\n\nNext, let's consider the lifespan of a tree. The lifespan of a tree can vary depending on the species, but on average, a tree can live for several decades to several centuries.\n\nUsing these assumptions, we can estimate the total amount of energy a tree can produce through photosynthesis in its lifetime. Assuming a tree lives for 50 years and produces 20-30 grams of glucose per day, it would produce a total of 12,500 to 18,750 grams of glucose over its lifetime.\n\nTo convert this to energy, we can use the fact that one gram of glucose contains approximately 4 kilojoules of energy. Therefore, the total amount of energy a tree can produce through photosynthesis in its lifetime is 50 years x 365 days/year x 24 hours/day x 4 kilojoules/gram x 12,500 to 18,750 grams of glucose = 1,250 to 1,875 megajoules.\n\nIt's important to note that this is just an estimate based on some general assumptions and average values, and the actual amount of energy a tree can produce through photosynthesis in its lifetime can vary significantly depending on the species of tree, its age, health, and environmental conditions.</s>"], "idxs": [149, 244], "new_tokens": [327, 444], "wall_time": [9.82668423652649, 16.460657358169556], "accept_lengths:": [1, 5, 9, 5, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 4, 8, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 9, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 9, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 6, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1]}], "tstamp": 1712635408.9361844}
